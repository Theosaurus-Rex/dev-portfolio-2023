# Weeknotes March 17 2025

## Work

- More clean-up of outdated and dead code. Removing code is at least very satisfying, if not very challenging ðŸ˜Œ
- Our team size will reduce by half from next week, so enjoying having extra people around while it lasts
- Figuring out a bunch of stuff around how we currently manage liquid templates in Shopify in preparation for developing a couple of new ones

## Other Dev

- Still working on the revamp of this website. The landing page is moving along, and the content pages should be less of a hassle.
- Lots of little project ideas still bumping around in my head, but need to focus on the site rework first lest I get distracted and finish absolutely nothing again.

## Learning

- I feel like I'm constantly bumping into new things in CSS I wasn't aware of this week! I was reading the docs on the [masonry layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Masonry_layout), which is still an experimental feature but seems cool!
- Back onto The Joy of React this week in fits and bursts as I have time. Still working through the hooks module

## Personal

- Feeling a bit of burnout post-diagnosis, which a friend has said is normal from what she's read. It's a lot to come to terms with, so I'm starting with the book [Your Brain's Not Broken](https://www.amazon.com.au/Your-Brains-Not-Broken-Strategies/dp/0800739426) by Tamara Rosier. Big thank you to Chris Ferdinandi and the ADHD folks in his discord server for book suggestions!
- Singing lessons went super well this week! We nailed [Faithfully by Journey](https://youtu.be/OMD8hBsA-RI?si=agZt05KfVc2Ma1jH) in half an hour (including warmups) to the surprise of both myself and my teacher. Songs with a B5 are my "rest" songs now which is huge progress from a few months ago when I was red in the face trying to hit that note

## Links of the Week

- [Cottagecore Programmers](https://tjmorley.com/blogposts/cottagecoreprogrammers.html) by Theodore Morley (I grew up on a farm as well and can tell you it's not as ideal as developers like to fantasize about)
