# Weeknotes April 7 2025

## Work

- Continuation of the general chaos from the last few weeks.
- Implemented some API stuff with Klaviyo and our frontend which may not be needed now? Status unclear
- Starting to look into generating Tailwind config from a static design (e.g. Figma) as part of an initiative at work to find ways to speed up our development cycle. Currently fleshing out a couple of test cases, and the plan is to see which model produces the most accurate/desirable output

## Learning

- Trying to learn about NextJS Server Actions and getting more and more confused the more I read
- Learning more about Hotwire/Turbo for a side project in Rails

## Personal

- Generally feeling completely drained, but I think the post-diagnosis burnout is finally wearing off. Nothing I do seems to refill my cup though, even activities I normally find very fulfilling.
- Finally finished that scarf I was working on (that I incorrectly estimated I would finish, like, 3 weeks ago). Have now started a matching beanie following [this pattern](https://www.knittinghousesquare.com/head/ribbed-beanie-knit-flat)
- Currently reading [Unmasking Autism](https://www.amazon.com.au/Unmasking-Autism-Discovering-Faces-Neurodiversity/dp/0593235231) by Devon Price
