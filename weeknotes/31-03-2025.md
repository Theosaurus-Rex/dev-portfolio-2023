# Weeknotes March 31 2025

## Work

- Calming the panic when Shopify had an outage on Wednesday afternoon. It was only about 45 minutes, but I hate to think how many businesses it affected.
- Working on everyone's favourite thing in the world, liquid templates.
- Figuring out a Klaviyo integration with our existing frontend infrastructure

## Other Dev

- Little bits and pieces such as dependency upgrades, but nothing major this week. Too exhausted.

## Learning

- Courses are on the backburner again for now - I keep looking at my copy of [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) and then being intimidated by Maths™️
- Refreshing my Ruby and Rails knowledge a bit and learning about Turbo/Stimulus for a potential upcoming side project. This stuff has come SO far since I studied it at bootcamp.

## Personal

- A dear former colleague and friend passed away this week after a battle with cancer, and I am heartbroken. Rest in peace, Paul - you were the best of us and the last person who deserved this. If I write more about this I am going to cry.
- Finished my previous book and started reading [Unmasked](https://www.penguin.com.au/books/unmasked-9780241652015) by Ellie Middleton. I'm enjoying it so far and appreciate the discussion around intersectional marginalisation in the AuDHD community.
