# Weeknotes April 14 2025

## Work

- Fiddling with tricky API integrations and updating the endpoint last-minute due to unspoken requirements that came to light much later than I would have liked
- Still glancing at these experiments into generating decent Tailwind configs from Figma mockups, but have had less time to do so this week

## Other Dev

## Learning

## Personal

- Got rejected as a speaker from YOW Sydney - I'm not super surprised since I get the vibe that people in individual contributor roles generally aren't accepted, as it skews towards business leaders, but still stings a bit
- Finished knitting a beanie for myself, starting on one for someone's birthday coming up later in the year. Learned that certain types of stitch markers can really mess up your stitches when positioned incorrectly, so might invest in some that are designed to sit between stitches other than trying to make it work with bulky clip-style ones I already have.
