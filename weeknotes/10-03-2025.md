## Work

- Quiet start to the week as it was a public holiday in Melbourne on Monday, meaning that my current client was offline

## Learning

Currently still working through Josh W. Comeau's Joy of React course, focusing on the Hooks module this week. Some interesting snippets I've picked up so far:

- `useRef` can actually hold more than just DOM nodes - I've just never seen this done before
- Calling `useRef` with an empty dependency array is the canonical way to run something once after the component mounts, and never again - this has always felt a bit hacky to me but Josh is saying this is the correct way to do it
- Learning some general bits and pieces about cleaning up `useEffect`s when we add in global event listeners and so on. I'm grateful I come from a functional programming background, so returning a function inside a function is pretty natural to me at this stage.
